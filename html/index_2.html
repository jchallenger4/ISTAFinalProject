		<p>Notes: 1) The menu items Argylle, Megamind, and Oppenheimer will be removed. I want to add them as a drop down for Glossary.</p>
		<p>2) I've worked on: Home, Argylle, Megamind, and About. I've kinda jumped btwn HTML and CSS, so some look funky. If anyone finishes a movie page, the styling will be the same for all 3. P.S. I used ChatGPT for the About section and for mock movie revies</p>
		<p>3) HTML & CSS have been such headaches with some things, so I've found workarounds. For ex: I can't display images unless they're in the same folder as HTML files, which is why they're all thrown together willy-nilly. Originally, I had them placed in the graphics folder, but they didn't render. Sorry if things are ugly, I just wanted to make it functional before worrying about the rest.</p>
		<p>4) Currently, there's no Javascript at all, but we'll need some on 2 pages. I was thinking maybe calling an API to show movie showtimes? If that's too complicated, we can also use just a table for that and have static showtimes. P.S. I've no idea if we can use Angular, React, etc. but have been operating under the assumption that we can't</p>
		<p>Re: requirements: I'm using tables for cast information on movie pages (they aren't styled so they look bad rn), and I'm using a form (a contact form on the about page)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Appropriate Meta Tags</li>
			<li>1 Page using a table to display data</li>
			<li>One email hyperlink</li>
			<li>Consistent banner logo area (DONE) </li> 
			<li>Consistent Main Navigation (mostly done, need to add Argylle, MM, and Oppenheimer as a drop down menu.</li>
			<li> Association with .css file (DONE)</li>
			<li>Multimedia Element: YT vid, CSS image gallery, or CSS Transition (DONE - YT vids)</li>
			<li>One page containing a form with at least three elements (IN PROGRESS - contact form)</li>
			<li>Use of JS on TWO pages</li>
			<li>All browsers must be able to render each page (so far I've only used Chrome)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>I don't know why the site scrolls horizontally.</strong> Also, buttons aren't styled or functional. Also, I chose this random idea and color scheme. Open to switching. I honestly didn't put much thought into it</p>
