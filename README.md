I've (Mike) added a working homepage, with a dark mode toggle for our javascript. I would leave the homepage alone as it is pretty much complete other than if you need to update a filename. Each of the pages should have pretty much the same header and head. This will keep the banner and favicon consistent. I also added a new stylesheet, styles2.css. 

  Try not to break anything. I'd recommend just adding styles to the bottom of the page because multiple sheets may get a little tricky. 

  Keep the file types separated by their respective folders. Linking is easy. If you are in an html file and want to link and image, you just link the relative path to the image. ../images/example.jpg 

**Done**:
- One e-mail hyperlink
- Consistent banner logo area
- Consistent main navigation
- Multimedia Element: YouTube video, CSS image gallery, or CSS Transition
- One page containing a form with at least three elements
- Use of JavaScript on one page
- 
**Todo**:
- Appropriate meta tags
- One page utilizing tables effectively to display tabular information (making sure the data being shared is clearly explained): probably best for the showtimes page
- Use of JavaScript on one page
- Consistent banner logo area (keep banner consistent)
- W3C Validation and accessibility standards
